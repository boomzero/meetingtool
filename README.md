Are you looking for a convenient and easy way to join your online classes? Do you want to avoid the hassle of typing in meeting IDs and passwords every time? Do you wish you could just copy and paste the information with one click? If you answered yes to any of these questions, then you need to check out this amazing code!

This code is a simple and effective solution for joining your online classes on WeMeet. It uses a YAML file to store your class information, such as name, meeting ID, password, start time, and whether you want to auto-join or not. It also uses the clip library to copy the meeting ID or password to your clipboard whenever a class starts. It even opens the WeMeet app for you if you enable the auto-join option. All you need to do is run this code in the background and let it do the work for you!

This code is written in C++ and uses the yaml-cpp and clip libraries. It works on all platforms. It is easy to customize and modify according to your preferences and schedule. You can add or remove classes, change the meeting IDs or passwords, adjust the start times, and toggle the `enableMsg`, `passwordProtected`, and `autoJoin` options. You can also change the output messages to suit your liking.

This code is a great example of how you can use C++ to automate your daily tasks and make your life easier. It is also a fun and educational project that can help you learn more about C++, YAML, and clip. You can download this code and try it out for yourself. You will be amazed by how much time and effort you can save with this code!
